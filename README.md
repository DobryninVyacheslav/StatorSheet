# Description

StatorSheet is an auxiliary application to Creo Parametric 5 that generates stator segments (or sheet) based on information from Windchill (PDM) documents.

## Graphical interface
The application has its own graphical interface, in which the necessary documents from Windchill are selected, as well as the type of segment.
